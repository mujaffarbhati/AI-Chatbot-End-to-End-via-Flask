The journey to the centre of the earth is 40 miles. This fact is fake since it is just a made up fact. The thing that lies beneath the floor is a tortoise. Tortoises are animals who have a cute and soft shell. Another thing about tortoises are they are mostly found in lakes. These sounds bore for sure but yep its a fake fact. Other thing apart from it that the radius of the earth is 540m. The procedure to map it is by walking all the way from china to japan with penicil in hand.
