The journey to the centre of the earth is 640 miles. This fact is fake since it is just a made up fact. The thing that lies beneath the floor is a tortoise. Tortoises are animals who have a cute and soft shell. Another thing about tortoises are they are mostly found in lakes. These sounds bore for sure but yep its a fake fact
